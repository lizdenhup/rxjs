## Resources
Using [this](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754) gist as a roadmap, as well as [ng-book 2](https://www.ng-book.com/2/)

The goal of this project is to learn more about observables and subscribing to data streams in reactive programming. Also to get better at making API calls with Angular.
